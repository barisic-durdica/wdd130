            <h2>History</h2>
            <div id="history">
                <p>Down The River was founded in 2001 with a simple mission: to share the beauty and
                    excitement of river rafting with everyone. What began as a small family-run
                    operation with just two rafts and a handful of passionate guides quickly grew
                    into a trusted local adventure company. From the beginning, safety,
                    professionalism, and unforgettable experiences have been at the heart of
                    everything we do. Over the years, we have expanded our routes to include
                    beginner-friendly scenic floats, intermediate adventures, and challenging rapids
                    for experienced thrill-seakers.</p>
