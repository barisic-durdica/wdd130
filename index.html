            <p>My name is Durdica and I live in the UK. I am currently working full
                time and studying Software development. This is a completely new subject for me as I
                previously studied Economics. I am really enjoying my studies so far and I am very
                excited to see where this path may take me in the future. </p>
            <p>I am also a wife and a mother of two very energetic little boys. We also have a dog,
                a
                golden retriever, and her name is Vanilla. We enjoy very much taking her for a walk,
                which she absolutely loves, however, she also enjoys to just chill next to a warm
                radiator. We also love to travel and learn about different cultures. Getting on an
                airplane is a huge event for a 4 and a 2 year old, as you can imagine.</p>
            <p>In my free time I also love to crochet, especially amigurumis. Amigurumis are
                crocheted
                stuffed toys. They can make beautiful gifts, especially in festive season. I learnt
                to
                crochet in 2021 and I have really been enjoying it so much. With almost every
                project I
                learn a new stitch, its just never ending, especially in amigurumis because you can
                have
                so many different details. I really just enjoy being creative and learning new
                skills.

            <p>London is the capital and largest city of England and the UK. It is political,
