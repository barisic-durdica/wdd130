        <p>My name is Durdica and I live in the UK. In my free time I love to spend time in the
            nature with my family. I also love to crochet, especially amigurumis. I am currently
            working full time and studying Software development. This is a completely new subject
            for me as I previously studied Economics. I am really enjoying my studies so far and I
            am very excited to see where this path may take me.</p>
